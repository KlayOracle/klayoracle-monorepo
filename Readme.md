### Node Runner

- Generate a selfsigned certificate for each node. [see guide using open ssl](setup-guide/openssl).
- Use different authority or wildcard matching authority of each node you intend to run.
- In `node/config.yml`, set the `key` and the `pem` you used to generate the certificate.
- Give the certificate pem file to data providers for authenticating with your Node. You can also run your own data providers.
- Update your organization details in `node/config.yml`. Website must match authority used to sign certificate, an example will be if authority is `*.origineum.com`, website can be `node-1.origineum.com`. Otherwise, node service will fail to start.
- In `.env`, `HOST_IP` is the dns for reaching your node. If you're running a docker container, you can override it and other `env` variable by passing from terminal.
- In `.env` `PRIVATE_KEY` is your Node signer with enough Klay tokens to pay for request.
- In `.env` `COCKROACH_DNS_URL` is your full connection string to [https://cockroachlabs.cloud/](https://cockroachlabs.cloud/) cluster. A free account will suffice for a considerable period.
- In `.env` `OAUTH_TOKEN` is the Oauth token given to data providers using your Node.
- Run `make gomodtidy`, `make node-tables`, `make node-server-nolog HOST_IP=0.0.0.0:50054` or `make node-server HOST_IP=0.0.0.0:50054` on your local machine to test it locally

### DP Runner

- Using sample [KLAY_USD](data-provider/feeds/KLAY_USD.json) and [WEMIX_USD](data-provider/feeds/WEMIX_USD.json), add all the feeds your data provider will serving to consumer contract.
- Use the setup guide to understand and add a compatible feed. [Guide here](https://klayoracle.gitbook.io/v1.0.0/data-providers/)
- Using the `make` command, generate unique 32 bytes string identifier for each adapter feed. example ` ADAPTERS="KLAY_USD.json WEMIX_USD.json make adapter-id-gen"` will generate `adapterId` for each feed.
- Optionally if you prefer to prettifier your feed after generating `adapterId`, use https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/.
- Deploy [OracleProvider](https://github.com/KlayOracle/klayoracle-monorepo/blob/development/oracle-contract/contracts/OracleProviderSample.sol) contract for each feed and replace the `oracleAddress` key.
- Add the certificate of the Node your data provider will be using to `data-provider/certs/node`. Update the path in `data-provider/config.yml`.
- Update your organization details in `data-provider/config.yml`.
- In `.env`, `HOST_IP` is the dns for reaching your data provider. As a rule of thumb if you are running multiple data provider don't run on same host,
- Add the list of feeds to be loaded to `data-provider/config.yml`. Any `feed` name not listed will not be sent to the node for aggregation.
